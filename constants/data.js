He is an excellent communicator and understood our needs fast, although they were considered complex in our view. He knows his limits and when we asked for additional enhancements which were not agreed upon before staring the project, he asked for few days to search it and he solved the problem. I would definitely work with him in the future and certainly recommend him for any project if it is within his set of skills.",
